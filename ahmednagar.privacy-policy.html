          2.	PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT
        </h5>
        <p>
          &emsp; (a)	We collect different types of personal data about you in various ways, which we have grouped together as follows. The information that we collect may include: 
          <ol type="I">
          <li><strong>Identity Data,</strong> such as your name, username, and any similar identifier.

        &emsp; (b)	We also collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data under law as it does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &emsp; (c)  What happens if I refuse to provide my personal data? 
        <br />
        Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. In this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us.
      </p>



        <br/>
        <h5>
          3.	HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA?

        </p>
        <p>
        &emsp; (a)<strong>	Direct Interactions.</strong> You provide us your personal data when you interact with us. This includes personal data you provide when you request marketing to be sent to you, or when you give us feedback or contact us.

          4.	HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
        </h5>
        <p>
          &emsp; (a)	We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests, or where we need to comply with a legal obligation. We use your personal data for the following purposes:
          
          <ol type="I">
            <li>To personalize your experience: Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.
            </li><li>To improve our services: We continually strive to improve our service offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
            </li><li>To send periodic emails, including marketing emails: The email address you provide may be used to send you marketing emails, information, and updates, in addition to receiving occasional company news and updates related to us or our business.
            </li><li>To comply with legal obligations.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; (b)	Where applicable laws permit us to, we rely on your consent as a ground to process your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
        &emsp; (c)	Where applicable law does not permit us to rely on your consent to process personal data, we rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data:
        
        <ol type="I">
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests,</strong> which means our interest in conducting and managing our business to enable us to provide you with the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
          </li><li><strong>Performance of a contract,</strong> which means we process your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
          </li><li><strong>To comply with a legal obligation,</strong> which means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to. 
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp; (d)	We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
        </p>
